# :zap: Description
Scrape the website [Music3000](https://www.music3000.fr) to extract and organize guitar information into a properly formatted CSV file.

<br>

## 📋 Overview 
This project involves web scraping the Music3000 website to gather detailed information about guitars. The extracted data will be structured and saved into a CSV file for easy analysis and reference.

<br>

## 💻 Technologies Used 
- **Python** : Utilized for web scraping.
- **Beautiful Soup** : A Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.
- **Requests** : A Python library for making HTTP requests.

<br>

## 🚀 How it Works 
1. The Python script sends HTTP requests to the Music3000 website.
2. The HTML content of the pages is parsed using Beautiful Soup.
3. Relevant information about guitars (e.g., model, price, specifications) is extracted.
4. The extracted data is organized and saved into a CSV file.

<br>
